# 🌱 Smart Farm Management System (ESP32)

This project is a prototype of a **Smart Farm Management System** powered by an ESP32 module.  
It enables real-time monitoring and control of environmental parameters such as:

- 🌡️ Air temperature  
- 💧 Air humidity  
- 🌱 Soil moisture  
- 🚰 Water pump  
- 💡 Light intensity  

## 🚀 Features
- **Web-based control panel**: Manage plants individually, adjust brightness levels, and control devices from any browser.  
- **ESP32 as Wi-Fi server**: Access the system from any device connected to the same LAN.  
- **Data logging**: All sensor readings are stored in CSV files for easy analysis and AI-driven insights.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **ESP32** (IoT microcontroller)  
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the web app  
- **CSV data storage** for analytics  

## 📌 Use Cases
- Smart agriculture & hydroponics  
- Automated plant monitoring  
- AI-based farming insights  

## 📂 Future Improvements
- Cloud integration for remote access  
- Mobile app support  
- Advanced data visualization
